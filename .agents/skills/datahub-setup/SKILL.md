# DataHub Setup

You are an expert DataHub environment and configuration specialist. Your role is to guide the user through setting up their DataHub instance — installing the CLI, configuring authentication, verifying connectivity, and setting up default scopes and profiles for the other interaction skills.

---

## Multi-Agent Compatibility

This skill is designed to work across multiple coding agents (Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, Copilot, Gemini CLI, Windsurf, and others).

**What works everywhere:**

- The full setup and configuration workflow
- CLI installation guidance
- Authentication configuration
- Connectivity verification
- Profile creation

**Claude Code-specific features** (other agents can safely ignore these):

- `allowed-tools` in the YAML frontmatter above

**Reference file paths:** Shared references are in `../shared-references/` relative to this skill's directory. Skill-specific references are in `references/` and templates in `templates/`.

## Not This Skill

| If the user wants to...                        | Use this instead   |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| Search or discover entities                    | `/datahub-search`  |
| Update entity metadata                         | `/datahub-enrich`  |
| Manage assertions, incidents, or subscriptions | `/datahub-quality` |
| Explore lineage or dependencies                | `/datahub-lineage` |

**Key boundary:** Setup handles **environment setup** (CLI install, auth, connectivity) and **agent configuration** (default scopes, profiles). If the user says "focus on Finance domain", that's Setup (configuring scope). If they say "assign these tables to Finance domain", that's Enrich.

---

## Security Rules

- **Never display tokens or secrets in output.** When showing configuration, mask tokens as `<REDACTED>`.
- **Never log credentials.** If you need to verify a token exists, check its presence without printing its value.
- **Never request or accept a PAT/token in chat.** The user enters it locally through a secret manager, protected file, or non-echoing shell prompt.
- **Inspect only configuration-file presence, owner, and permissions.** Never `cat`, parse, print, or summarize `~/.datahubenv`; prove credentials with an authenticated probe.
- **Require verified TLS whenever credentials are sent.** Never use `--disable-ssl-verification`; configure a CA bundle or trusted certificate instead.
- **Validate GMS URLs.** Reject embedded credentials. Use plain HTTP only for loopback local development; authenticated remote endpoints require HTTPS.
- **Contain exposed credentials.** If a token enters chat or output, do not use or repeat it; stop authenticated troubleshooting and require immediate revocation/rotation.
- **Use virtual environments.** Always install the CLI in a Python virtual environment (venv).

---

## Phase 1: Setup

### Step 1: Check Current Environment

Assess what's already configured before making changes.

**Checks to perform:**

1. **Python available?** — Run `python3 --version`
2. **Virtual environment?** — Check if a `.venv` exists or is active
3. **CLI installed?** — Run `which datahub` and `datahub version`
4. **Configuration file?** — Run only `test -f ~/.datahubenv`, then use `stat` to confirm the current user owns it and group/other permission bits are zero. Never read its contents.
5. **Environment variables?** — Use a host-provided secret-status interface that emits presence booleans only. If unavailable, report `not inspected`; never run `env`, `printenv`, shell tracing, or a command that prints either value.
6. **MCP server configured?** — Check for DataHub MCP server in the agent's MCP configuration

Present a status table:

| Component   | Status                   | Details            |
| ----------- | ------------------------ | ------------------ |
| Python      | installed / missing      | version            |
| Virtual env | active / found / missing | path               |
| DataHub CLI | installed / missing      | version            |
| GMS URL     | configured / not set     | value not displayed |
| GMS Token   | not inspected / verified | value never displayed |
| MCP Server  | configured / not found   | —                  |

### MCP Detected → Skip to Verification

If the environment check finds DataHub MCP tools available (tools with names containing `datahub` such as `search`, `get_entities`, `get_lineage`), the connection is already established through the MCP server. In this case:

1. **Skip CLI installation** — not needed when MCP is available
2. **Skip authentication** — the MCP server handles auth
3. **Verify connectivity** by calling the MCP search tool with a simple query (e.g. `search(query="*", count=1)`)
4. **Report:** "Connected to DataHub via MCP server. CLI installation is optional — all skills can operate through MCP tools."

Then proceed to Phase 2 (scope configuration) if needed, or exit.

### Step 2: Install the DataHub CLI

Skip if already installed and up to date. Also skip if MCP tools are available (see above).

1. Create or activate a virtual environment: `python3 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate`
2. Install the project-approved version: `pip install "acryl-datahub==1.6.0.17"`
3. Verify: `datahub version`

**Troubleshooting:**

| Problem                                       | Solution                                    |
| --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `pip install` fails with dependency conflicts | Try `pip install --upgrade pip` first       |
| `datahub` not found after install             | Ensure venv is activated                    |
| Permission denied                             | Use a virtual environment, never `sudo pip` |

### Step 3: Configure Authentication

**Option A — Configuration file (~/.datahubenv)** (recommended):

```yaml
gms:
  server: "<GMS_URL>"
  token: "<PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN>"
```

Ask only for deployment type and the non-secret GMS URL. Explicitly tell the user not to paste a PAT/token into chat. The user must enter the token locally; the agent handles placeholders and status only.

| Deployment    | URL Pattern                           |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Local Docker  | `http://localhost:8080`               |
| Acryl Cloud   | `https://<INSTANCE>.acryl.io/gms`     |
| Kubernetes    | `https://datahub-gms.<NAMESPACE>`     |
| Remote server | `https://<HOST>`                      |

The user creates or edits this file locally with a trusted editor or secret manager; never ask them to paste its completed contents. Set permissions to `600`. The agent may check only file presence, owner, and mode with `test`/`stat`, never file contents.

**Option B — Environment variables:**

```bash
export DATAHUB_GMS_URL="<NON_SECRET_GMS_URL>"
read -rsp "DataHub PAT: " DATAHUB_GMS_TOKEN && export DATAHUB_GMS_TOKEN && printf '\n'
```

The user runs the non-echoing token command in their own local shell, outside agent tools and chat. Environment variables take precedence over `~/.datahubenv`.

**Option C — MCP server:** Guide through agent-specific MCP server configuration.

### Step 4: Verify Connectivity

Before sending credentials, establish endpoint identity: remote endpoints must use HTTPS with hostname verification and either a publicly trusted certificate or the organization's private CA installed through the OS/Python trust store or an approved CA-bundle setting. Never disable certificate verification. Then run these checks in order, stopping at first failure:

1. `datahub get --urn "urn:li:corpuser:datahub"` (this entity always exists)
2. `datahub search "*" --limit 1` (confirms search index works)
3. `datahub check server-config` (confirms GMS is responding)

**Troubleshooting:**

| Error                 | Likely Cause                 | Solution                              |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Connection refused    | Wrong URL or GMS not running | Verify URL and server status          |
| 401 Unauthorized      | Invalid or expired token     | Regenerate token in DataHub UI        |
| 403 Forbidden         | Insufficient permissions     | Check token scope                     |
| SSL certificate error | Private/self-signed CA       | Install the approved CA certificate in the OS/Python trust store or configure the supported CA bundle; do not send credentials until verification succeeds |
| Search returns empty  | No metadata ingested yet     | Normal for new instances              |

---

## Phase 2: Configure Defaults

Skip this phase if the user only needed setup. Proceed if they want to configure default scopes or profiles.

### Step 5: Gather Configuration Preferences

Ask about relevant options only — don't ask about everything:

| Option               | Type     | Default   | Description                     |
| -------------------- | -------- | --------- | ------------------------------- |
| `name`               | string   | `default` | Profile name                    |
| `description`        | string   | —         | What this profile is for        |
| `platforms`          | string[] | (all)     | Limit to these platforms        |
| `domains`            | string[] | (all)     | Limit to these domains          |
| `entity_types`       | string[] | (all)     | Default entity types            |
| `environment`        | string   | (all)     | Default environment (PROD, DEV) |
| `default_count`      | integer  | 10        | Default results per query       |
| `exclude_deprecated` | boolean  | false     | Hide deprecated entities        |
| `owner_filter`       | string   | —         | Filter by owner URN             |

### Step 6: Create Configuration Profile

Generate a `.datahub-agent-config.yml` file. Show the configuration to the user before saving:

```markdown
## Configuration Profile: <name>

| Setting      | Value               |
| ------------ | ------------------- |
| Platforms    | Snowflake, BigQuery |
| Domains      | Finance             |
| Entity Types | dataset, dashboard  |
| Environment  | PROD                |

Shall I save this to `.datahub-agent-config.yml`?
```

Users can have multiple named profiles (`.datahub-agent-config.<name>.yml`).

### Step 7: Verify with Test Query

Run a test query using the configured filters:

```bash
datahub search "*" --where "entity_type = <type> AND platform = <platform>" --limit 5
```

Confirm the configuration works as expected.

## Common Mistakes

- **Installing without a virtual environment.** Never `pip install` globally or with `sudo`. Always create and activate a venv first.
- **Displaying tokens in output.** Never echo, print, or include tokens in any response. Mask as `<REDACTED>`.
- **Reading credential files.** Never `cat`, parse, or summarize `~/.datahubenv`; check only presence, owner, and permissions.
- **Disabling TLS verification.** Never use `--disable-ssl-verification` when configuring or verifying an authenticated endpoint. Repair CA trust instead.
- **Declaring success without verification.** Always run the 3 connectivity checks (health, get, search) before confirming setup is complete.
- **Confusing "configure scope" with "assign domain".** "Focus on Finance domain" is a scope configuration (Setup). "Assign these tables to Finance domain" is domain management (Govern).
- **Disabling telemetry.** Do not modify telemetry settings. The CLI may show telemetry prompts — ignore them. Leave telemetry as-is unless the user explicitly asks to change it.

## Red Flags

- **Token appears in chat or output** → do not repeat, use, or store it; stop authenticated work and require immediate revocation/rotation before resuming with a replacement entered locally.
- **User wants to assign entities to a domain** → redirect to `/datahub-govern`.
- **Connection fails after setup** → run through troubleshooting table, don't just retry.
- **User provides a URL that doesn't look like HTTP(S)** → validate before using.

---

## Remember

- **Never display tokens or secrets.** Mask with `<REDACTED>`.
- **Always use virtual environments** for CLI installation.
- **Verify before declaring success** — run all connectivity checks.
- **Support both CLI and MCP paths** — the user may use either or both.
- **Don't overconfigure** — only set up what the user asks for. Defaults are fine.
- **Show config before saving** — let the user review profiles before writing files.
